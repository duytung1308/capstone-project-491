      "answer": "Developed to execute high-level language programs directly, avoid the delay of compilation, although they run slower than compiled programs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do interpreters run slower than compiled programs?",
      "answer": " Interpreters execute code line by line, translating each statement into machine code or an intermediate representation at runtime. This continuous translation process incurs overhead, making the execution slower, while compiled programs are translated into machine code before execution, allows compilers to perform optimizations and produce more efficient code, contributing to faster execution."

    {
      "question": "What is machine language",
      "answer": "Defined by its hardware design. Machine languages generally consist of strings of numebrs (ultimately reduced to 1s and 0s). Machine languages are machine dependent, and are not portable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did we use assmebly language over machine language?",
      "answer": "Programming in machine langugae was simply too slow and tedious for most programmers. Assembly language was designed to be faster and easier to read and write. Assembly language is also more portable than machine language. Translator programs called assemblers were developed to convert early assembly-language programs to machine language at computer speeds"

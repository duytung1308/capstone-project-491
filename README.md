# capstone-project-491
This is my project for CPSC 491
My project was to create a chatbot that can learn from users, and help users with C++ programming questions, it was intended to run over a server, 
and as of now 12/12/2023 I am still working on establishing a connection between my chatbot written in Python and Xampp server. It was intended that a 
user could enter input through a chatbox that is then sent to the chatbot for processing and then return a response matching its database, if not it will
ask the user to teach it how to reply next time.

You only need to download main.py and bot.json in order to run the chatbot in either visual code studio, or python

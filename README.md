# capstone-project-491
This is my project for cpsc 491
My project was to create a chatbot that can learn from user, help users with C++ programming questions, it was intended to run over server, 
as of now 12/12/2023 I am still working on establishing a connection between my chatbot written in python and Xampp server. It was intend that a 
user could enter input through a chatbox that is then send to chatbot for processing and then return a repsonse matching its database, if not it will
ask the user to teach it how to reply next time.
